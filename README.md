Section A: Answer ONE question
1.       Answer   both   (a)   and   (b).
(a)      A certain disease   has two treatment alternatives. The   cost   of Treatment A   is   1200 pounds while the cost of Treatment   B   is 2400   pounds. A   doctor   must   decide   which treatment to   prescribe to a   patient.    If the   doctor   chooses Treatment A,   the probability that the treatment will succeed   is 0.5, and   if they   choose Treatment   B,   the   probability that the treatment will succeed   is 0.75.   If the treatment   is   successful (under each of the two alternatives), then the   patient   gains   20   units   of   QUALY   (i.e.,   Quality Adjusted   Life Years) and   if the treatment fails, then the   patient will   gain   only   4   units of   QUALY.
i)          Assume that the doctor   is   an   employee   of   an   HMO that   provides   treatment   at   no   cost to   all   its enrollees.    If the   doctor’s   objective   is to   maximize   each   patient’s   expected   QUALY, which of the two treatments will the doctor   choose?   (6   marks)
ii)       Will the doctor’s   behavior   lead to   a   problem   of   moral   hazard   for   the   HMO?       (6   marks)
iii)    Assume   now that the doctor sees   numerous   patients   and   their   objective   is   to   maximize the sum of the expected   QUALY of the   patients   being treated.      Further   assume that the   HMO sets a “fixed   budget”   of   24,000   pounds for   each   doctor   treating this specific disease. That   is, once the total cost   for   treating   the   doctor’s   patients for this disease   reaches   24,000   pounds, the doctor cannot   accept any   additional   patients with the disease. Which of the two treatment   alternatives   will   the doctor choose and   is there   a   moral   hazard   problem   in this   case?   (6   marks)
iv)    Assume   now that some of the   patients   suffering from this   disease   do   not   respond   to Treatment A   (i.e.,   if they   are treated   using this alternative, the treatment   will fail) and the doctor can   identify these   patients   in   advance.   Will the   HMO’s   policy described   in section   iii   above create a   problem of   adverse   selection?   (6   marks)
v)       Assume again that   all   patients are   identical   and   that,   for   each   patient,   if the doctor chooses Treatment A, the   probability that the treatment will   succeed   is 0.5, and   if they choose Treatment   B, the   probability that the treatment will   succeed   is 0.75.   However,   assume   now that the doctor   is   not   an   employee of the      HMO   but   rather, they work as a subcontractor for   the   HMO   and   they   (the   doctor)   has to   bear the entire cost of treatment   themself.      Suppose   that   the   doctor   can   choose   between two contracts.   Under the first, they are   paid   1200   pounds for   each   patient that they treat.   Under the   second, they are   paid   800   pounds   if the treatment fails and   1400   pounds   if   it succeeds. The doctor’s   utility from treating   each   patient   is given   by:
U(Q, F, C)   =   100Q   +   (1600   + F   −   C)1⁄2
where   Q   is the QUALY of the treatment’s outcome,   F   is the   reimbursement   the doctor   receives from the   HMO and   C is the treatment’s cost. Which   of   the   two contracts will the doctor choose   if their objective   is to   maximize   expected   utility?      (8   marks)
(b)   Below are three different   mechanisms that   have   been applied,   in   different   countries around the world,   in order to   improve the efficiency   of their   health   care   systems.   For   each   of the above   mechanisms explain   in   not   more than five sentences   how   they   were supposed to   improve social efficiency and   provide   an   explanation   of   why   they   have   not   been so   successful.

2.       Answer   both   parts   (a)   and   (b).
(a)    A   large   number of   hospitals around the world   are   compensated   according   to   the   DRG   (Diagnosis   Related Group)   model. According to this   model, a   list of   diagnoses   is   determined, and a   price   is determined for   each   one. When   a   patient   arrives   at   the   hospital, the doctors determine the   "main” diagnosis of   their   medical   problem,   and   the   hospital   is   reimbursed   according to the   price assigned to that diagnosis   (regardless of the   length of the   hospitalization or the   procedures   performed   during it).   Please answer the following questions on   how to   determine the   diagnosis   groups   and their   prices:
i)       One   possibility for   determining the   diagnosis groups   is to classify   all   diseases   into   a   relatively small   number of   "diagnoses” such that   each one   includes   various   conditions of the same disease or   even   several   relatively   similar   diseases. Examples of diagnoses   might   be   “Prostate   Cancer”, “heart   problems”, etc.    An alternative   is to classify all   diseases   into a   large   number   of   diagnoses where   at least some of the   DRGs will also   include   a   procedure.   Examples   of   diagnoses might   be   "heart   problem with   catheterization",   "heart   problem with drug   treatment", etc.   Using the   ideas discussed   in   class, compare the advantages   and         disadvantages of the second   method   relative to the first.   [Your answer   should   be   no   longer than   half a   page]   (10   marks)
ii)       Another option   is to   classify diseases   in a   more   fine-grained   way,   that   is,   not   according to the   main   procedure called for   by the diagnosis,   but   rather according   to the degree of severity of the   problem   (for   example,   "severe   heart   problem",   "moderate   heart   problem", etc.).    Compare the advantages   and disadvantages   of   this   method   relative to the first one described   in   part a   (i.e., the   coarse-grained method).   [Your answer should   be   no   longer than half a   page]   (10   marks)
iii)       In some   countries where   the   DRG   system   is   used,   the   hospital   also   receives additional compensation for   "exceptional" cases.   Consider the following   (“retrospective”)   mechanism:   If the cost   of the treatment for a certain   patient   exceeds the compensation the   hospital will   receive according to the   relevant   DRG, then   it will   receive additional compensation at the   rate   of   50%   of   the amount   by which the cost   exceeds the   DRG   payment. What are the   advantages   and disadvantages of this   method   relative to the   method with   no   retrospective   payments?   [Your answer should   be   no   longer than   half a   page]   (10   marks)
(b)    For   each of the statements   below,   please   state   whether   it   is   “Right”   or   “Wrong”   and   briefly   (in   no   more the   3-4 sentences) explain your answer:
i)       “If demand for   health services   is   not   perfectly   inelastic,   competitive   health   insurers   may   not   provide full   insurance.” (5   marks)
ii)       The   more “predictable”   or “predictive” a service   is, the   smaller   are the   plans’   incentives to   provide   it.   (5   marks)
iii)       “Pay for   performance   mechanisms are socially efficient   as they   affect   both   the demand for   high-quality sellers and the   incentives to   improve   quality.”   (5   marks)
iv)       “A   major   benefit of   bundled   payment   is the ability to target   incentives to   the         group of   physicians   primarily   re代 写EC9790 Health Economics May Examinations 2022/23Java

Section   B: Answer ONE question
3.       During 2013, some US   states   expanded   Medicaid   coverage   (which   provides   health   care   access   at   very low cost)   to some low-income childless adults. Researchers used a   survey   representative   at the state   level to   assess the effects of this   policy.

(a)       The figure above   plots the share of   survey   respondents   with   a   certain   characteristic.
i)          Describe the   figure   (2   marks)

(c)          Table   1,   Panel 4   reports the   impact of the   policy on   risky   behaviours   by   subgroup   of   respondents.   

i)         Describe the table   (2   marks)
ii)      Why would we expect   access to   health   insurance to affect   risky   behaviours?   Name two   mechanisms and   relate them to the   model of   risky   behaviours   discussed   in   class   (5   marks)
(d)         Based   on findings about the   price-elasticity of   preventative care,   an   employer   decides to   randomly offer a gym   membership to some   employees. The table   below   show   results from the experiment.

i)                  Describe the table   (2   marks)
ii)             Does the table support the   hypothesis that   gym   costs   are   a   barrier   for   employees? Why yes, why   not?   (5   marks)
(e)       The experiment was   an   encouragement   design:   individuals   in   the treatment   group   were encouraged to sign   up.   In   order to sign   up, they   had   to   complete   a   series   of screening and   activities. The table   below shows the   probability that   individuals   randomly assigned to the treatment group completed these   activities   based   on   their observable characteristics.

ii)    Does   lower   baseline   productivity cause   higher   probability of completing   activities?   Discuss   (3   marks)
iii) Can the   patterns   in this table   explain the findings   under   part   (d)? (3   marks)
(f)          Based   on your   answers to   the   previous   questions,   is   the   following   statement   true   or   false?   Discuss.
“Government and employer subsidies for   health   insurance   and   wellness   programs   are always welfare   improving”   .   (10   marks)
4.       Between   February   2004 and   September   2006,   Facebook was   rolled   out   across   US   colleges   in a staggered   fashion.
(a)       Figure   1 above shows   the   impact   of   the   introduction   of   Facebook   at   different colleges on students’   mental   health as   measured   by surveys   conducted   at the time.

i)    Describe the figure   (2   marks)
ii)    Can we   interpret these   patterns causally? Why yes   or   why   not?   (3   marks)
iii)    What   could   be the   concern   about the   use of survey data   in this   case?   What   do   we   need to assume about survey   responses for   the   results   to   be   valid?      (3   marks)
(b)       Researchers   recruited social   media   users for an   experiment.
To   participate   in the study,   people   had to   install an   app, only   available for Android   phones, that   records which   app   is   being   used   at   any time.   Does   this   requirement concern you for the   internal validity   of the study? And for   the   external   validity?   (3   marks)

i)    Describe the figure   (2   marks)
ii)    Can we conclude that social   media are   welfare   decreasing   from   this   figure?   Explain your answer.   (3   marks)
(d)       Participants were   randomly assigned to a   control   group,   a   bonus   group,   and   a   limit   group. The   bonus group   received   an   announcement   in   period   2   of the study that   indicated they would get a   bonus   if they   used social   media   less than   a   given   number   of   hours   in the   next   period   (period 3).   No   incentive was available for   periods   2, 4,   5.      The   limit group was given   access to an   app that   allows to   set   limits   on   next-day   social   media   use.   Users would then   receive   notification when their social   media   use   got   close to the   limit,   but were   able to snooze   away the   limit   (with some   delay)   once   it   hit.   Figure 4   below shows social   media   use   in these groups   relative to   the   control group.   

i)    Describe the   Figure.   (1   marks)
ii)    What do the temporal   patterns   in social   media   use for the   bonus   group   show   about digital addiction?   Relate your answer to the   model   of   addiction   seen   in   class.      (5   marks)
iii)    What   can   explain the effect   of the   limit treatment?   (3   marks)
(e)   The table   below shows the   results from a   regression   of wages   at   age   50   on   indicators for depression at   ages   27-35 with different   controls.
   
Robust standard errors in parentheses. All columns include   individual,   family   and   environmental   controls.
Individual controls include age, gender dummy, race dummies,   dummies   for   education   at   age   26,   a   dummy   for   marital   status   in   1992, work   experience   by   1992, the   average   percentage   of   weeks   the   person’s   work   history   data is missing, dummies for health status during childhood,   a   dummy   for   smoking behaviour   in   1992   and missing data indicators. Family controls include dummies on parental education   and   missing   data   indicators.
Environmental   controls   include   year   dummies, local   unemployment   rate   in   1992,   1998, 2004,   and   the   year outcome variables is collected, and missing data   indicators.
i)    Describe the table   (2   marks)
ii)    In   column   2, the authors add   controls for   depression   episodes   between   35   and 50 years of age to test whether   persistence of   depression   can   explain   the   productivity   result. What can you conclude from this test?   Is   this   a   valid   test?   Why yes or why   not?   (5   marks)
iii)    In   column   3, the authors add controls   for   work   experience   after   the   first   depression diagnosis   (human   capital accumulation).   Is this a   good   control?   Can   it   be   affected   by early depression?   (5   marks)
iv)    Are the   patterns   in this   table causal? Why yes   or why   not?   (3   marks)
(f)       Based   on your answers to the   above questions and   what   you   have   learnt   in   class,   discuss the following statement.
“Banning   social   media   would   be   welfare   improving.”           (10   marks)
